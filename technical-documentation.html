        <p>C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as
           an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over
            time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for
             low-level memory manipulation.</p>
             <p> It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors
             provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so
              it is available on many platforms.</p><br>

  VLSI
</header>
<p>Very large-scale integration was made possible with the wide adoption of the MOS transistor, originally invented by
   Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.[2] Atalla first proposed the concept of the MOS integrated
    circuit chip in 1960, followed by Kahng in 1961, both noting that the MOS transistor's ease of fabrication made it
     useful for integrated circuits.</p> <p>[3][4] General Microelectronics introduced the first commercial MOS integrated
      circuit in 1964.[5] In the early 1970s, MOS integrated circuit technology allowed the integration of more than 10,000
       transistors in a single chip.[6] This paved the way for VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, with tens of thousands of MOS
        transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions).</p>

          EMBEDED
        </header>
        <p>An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and
          input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical
           system.</p> <p> It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic
              hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations
               of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints. Embedded
                systems control many devices in common use today.[3] Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors
                 manufactured are used in embedded systems.</p><br>

          PLC
        </header>
<p>A programmable logic controller (PLC) or programmable controller is an industrial digital computer which has been
   ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, or robotic devices, or
    any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming and process fault diagnosis.</p>
<p>PLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of inputs and outputs (I/O), in a housing integral with the
   processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with a count of thousands of I/O, and which are often networked
    to other PLC and SCADA systems.</p><br>

        <p> is a scriptable electronic design automation (EDA) application with schematic capture, printed circuit board
           (PCB) layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) features.</p> <p> EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable
            Graphical Layout Editor (German: Einfach Anzuwendender Grafischer Layout-Editor) and is developed by CadSoft
             Computer GmbH. The company was acquired by Autodesk Inc. in 2016.[2]</p><br>
